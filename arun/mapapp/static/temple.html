        <p>The Vandiyur Mariamman Temple, commonly called Mariamman Kovil, is one of Madurai’s most famous and ancient temples, dedicated to Goddess Mariamman, the deity of rain, health, and protection. Located near the iconic Vandiyur Teppakulam, the temple is known for its deep cultural significance, where devotees come to pray for well-being, fertility, and relief from ailments. The temple is closely associated with the huge 16-acre Teppakulam tank, where the renowned Float Festival (Teppam) is celebrated every year with illuminated, decorated floats carrying deities around the tank. Rich in tradition and revered by locals, the Mariamman Kovil stands as a spiritual landmark blending history, devotion, and community heritage in Madurai.</p>
