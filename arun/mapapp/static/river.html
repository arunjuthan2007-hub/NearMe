        <p>The Vaigai River is an important river in Tamil Nadu and is often called the lifeline of Madurai. It originates from the Varusanadu Hills of the Western Ghats in Theni district and flows for about 258 km through the districts of Theni, Dindigul, Madurai, Sivagangai, and Ramanathapuram before emptying into the Palk Strait. The river receives water from several tributaries like the Suruli, Manjalar, Varaha, and Mullaiyaaru rivers. The famous Vaigai Dam, built across the river near Andipatti, supports irrigation and drinking water supply for many southern districts. Madurai city is historically and culturally connected with the Vaigai, and it is mentioned in ancient Sangam literature as “Vaiyai”. Though the river is seasonal and often dries during summer, it remains vital for agriculture, festivals, and the daily lives of the people living along its banks.</p>
